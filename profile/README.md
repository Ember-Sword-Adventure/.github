## 🌍 What is Ember Sword?

Ember Sword is a free-to-play MMORPG built on blockchain, where you explore a dynamic fantasy world, gather resources, master professions, and engage in real-time combat. All cosmetic drops are NFTs, and players can earn EMBER tokens by playing and participating in the in-game economy.

There are no fixed classes — your equipment and profession level determine your playstyle.
